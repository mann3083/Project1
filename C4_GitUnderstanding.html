<h3>Basics of Git</h3>
<p>
	<h4>Files in GitHub can be in any of the following three states:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Modified: In this state, modifications are made to a file or files, and the changes are still on our local system.

<li>Staged: In this stage, the changed files are added to the the staging area, which means the files will now become a part of your development history.</li>

<li>Committed: In this stage, we make a record or take a snapshot of the files we have added to the staging area or our development history.</li>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
	<h4>Pushing to Remote</h4>
	Use git push to push commits made on your local branch to a remote repository.
	The git push command takes two arguments:
	<ul>
		<li>REMOTENAME</li>
		<li>BRANCHNAME</li>
	</ul>
	<span>git push  REMOTENAME BRANCHNAME</span>
</p>
